## What is Vue?
Vue is a progressive framework for building user interfaces.  Unlike other monolithicframeworks, Vue is designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. Thecore library is focused on the view layer only, and is easy to pick up and integrate withother libraries or existing projects. On the other hand, Vue is also perfectly capable ofpowering sophisticated Single-Page Applications when used in combination with moderntooling and supporting libraries.
